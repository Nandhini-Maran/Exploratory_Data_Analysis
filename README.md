# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Used Cars Dataset

## Introduction
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset containing used car details. The goal is to understand the data, clean it, handle missing values, and extract useful insights that can help in making data-driven decisions.

## Dataset
The analysis is performed on the dataset **`used_cars_data.csv`**, which contains various attributes of used cars such as price, brand, model, year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, and more.

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries are used in this project:
- `pandas` - For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` - For numerical operations
- `matplotlib` - For data visualization
- `seaborn` - For advanced visualizations
- `datetime` - For handling date-related data
- `warnings` - To suppress unnecessary warnings

## Steps Performed
1. **Loading Data**: Reading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**:
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Distribution of numerical and categorical variables
   - Correlation analysis
   - Outlier detection
4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots
   - Heatmaps for correlation
   - Trend analysis over time
5. **Insights and Findings**:
   - Identifying key factors affecting used car prices
   - Common trends and patterns in the dataset

## How to Use
To run this notebook, install the required libraries and execute the cells sequentially:
    ```sh
  
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Then, open the Jupyter Notebook and run it.

## Conclusion
This EDA helps in understanding the dataset, identifying trends, and preparing the data for further machine learning models or business insights.
