# 🚗 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Used Cars Dataset  

## 📌 Introduction  
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset containing used car details. The goal is to **understand, clean, and analyze the data** to extract useful insights for data-driven decision-making.  

## 📂 Dataset  
The analysis is performed on **`used_cars_data.csv`**, which contains attributes like:  
✅ Price  
✅ Brand & Model  
✅ Year  
✅ Mileage  
✅ Fuel Type  
✅ Transmission  
✅ Other relevant details  

## 🛠️ Libraries Used  
The following **Python** libraries are used:  
📌 `pandas` - Data manipulation & analysis  
📌 `numpy` - Numerical operations  
📌 `matplotlib` - Data visualization  
📌 `seaborn` - Advanced visualizations  
📌 `datetime` - Handling date-related data  
📌 `warnings` - Suppressing unnecessary warnings  

## 🔍 Steps Performed  
1️⃣ **Loading Data** – Reading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame  
2️⃣ **Data Cleaning** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types  
3️⃣ **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - 📊 Descriptive statistics  
   - 📉 Distribution of numerical & categorical variables  
   - 🔗 Correlation analysis  
   - ⚠️ Outlier detection

4️⃣ **Data Visualization**  
   - 📈 Histograms, box plots, and scatter plots  
   - 🔥 Heatmaps for correlation  
   - 📆 Trend analysis over time  

## 📊 Insights and Findings  
🔹 Key factors affecting **used car prices**  
🔹 Common **trends and patterns** in the dataset  
🔹 Understanding the impact of **mileage, fuel type, and brand** on price  

## 🚀 How to Use  
To run this notebook, install the required libraries:  
```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```
Then, open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells sequentially.

## 🏁 Conclusion
This EDA helps in understanding the dataset, identifying trends, and preparing the data for machine learning models or business insights.
